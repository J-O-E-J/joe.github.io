        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Reason #1</h2>
            <p class="big-text">Our meeting was a beautiful act of fate. I never imagined I’d find someone as wonderful as you💖. Do you think the same?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Reason #2</h2>
            <p class="big-text">When we first met, I was completely overwhelmed. Looking at you felt surreal, and I found myself searching for words as you effortlessly drew everything out of me. I wanted to tell you that day then and there itself that you were just perfect ✨💕</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Reason #3</h2>
            <p class="big-text">I adored your beauty, your mind, and how you thought, spoke, and acted, but I never expected that I would have more things to love about you. One little truth game shattered all the boundaries between us. ❤✨</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Reason #4</h2>
            <p class="big-text">Even when the future feels uncertain, and you may wonder if I’m just running on butterflies, I believe I’ve struck gold. I feel like I’ve found something rare—something I may never find again. And so, I choose to believe in this uncertain future. So will you believe in the future I chose to believe in? 💫</p>
